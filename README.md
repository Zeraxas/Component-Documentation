# Componenet Documentation. Example Project.


This is my version of the technical documentation project created within a [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) course.

All materials were taken from [w3school.com](https://www.w3schools.com/). Every piece of content have a link to the original source.

Color scheme and many ideas in general were inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann [Advanced CSS Course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/v4/overview).
